PASSWORD GENERATOR

This JavaFX application, `MainGeneratorApp`, provides a simple user interface for generating passwords based on user input. The app includes a start screen with an image and a "Start" button, leading to a password generation screen where users input their first name, last name, and preferred username. Upon clicking "Generate Password," a password is generated and displayed using the `PasswordGenerator` class, all within a clean, light-themed GUI.
